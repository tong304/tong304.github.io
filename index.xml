      <description>XMag is the second Hugo theme I have designed. It is based on my first Hugo theme XMin, and similarly, features minimalism but with a magazine style on the homepage inspired by The Signpost on Wikipedia. You can find its source code on Github: https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmag (licensed under MIT).
Features This theme includes a few cool features:
  Responsive article summary blocks on homepage
  Thumbnails in summary blocks</description>
